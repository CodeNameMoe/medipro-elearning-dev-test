As part of my day 12 #100daysofcode challange, I wanted to build something with vanilla JavaScript as opposed to using react or next.js. I decided to build a landing page for Fanta zero, inspired partly by my healthy choice of beverage that day and a Starbucks landing page I came across.

## Main Learning Points:
