            {text: "Having a learning disability means that people find it harder to learn certain life skills. The problems experienced vary from person to person, but may include aspects such as learning new things, communication, managing money, reading, writing, or personal care. Some people are born with a disability, whereas others may develop one as a result of an accident or illness in childhood.", imgPath: "http://localhost:3000/first.jpg" },
        
            {text: "Types of learning disabilities differ hugely. Someone with mild disabilities may be able to live independently with minimal support, whereas someone with severe and profound disabilities may require 24 hour care and help with performing most daily living skills.", imgPath: "http://localhost:3000/1.jpg" },

            {text: "A learning disability is defined by the Department of Health as a “significant reduced ability to understand new or complex information, to learn new skills (impaired intelligence), with a reduced ability to cope independently (impaired social functioning), which started before adulthood”.", imgPath: "http://localhost:3000/1.jpg" },

            {text: "Sometimes, the term 'Global Developmental Delay' (GDD) is used to describe a learning disability. GDD describes a condition that occurs between birth and the age of 18 which prevents a child from reaching key milestones of development like learning to communicate, processing information, remembering things and organising their thoughts.", imgPath: "http://localhost:3000/1.jpg" },

            {text: "In general, a learning disability constitutes a condition which affects learning and intelligence across all areas of life, whereas a learning difficulty constitutes a condition which creates an obstacle to a specific form of learning, but does not affect the overall IQ of an individual.

            {text: "For example, Down’s syndrome is classed as a learning disability, whereas dyslexia is classed as a learning difficulty, in that it only affects an individual’s relationship to the processing of information, usually manifested in problems with reading, writing, and spelling.", imgPath: "http://localhost:3000/1.jpg" },

            {text: "A learning disability is a permanent condition developing at the latest in early childhood, whereas mental illness (or a mental health problem) can develop at any time, and is not necessarily permanent. People can get better and resolve mental health problems with help and treatment.", imgPath: "http://localhost:3000/1.jpg" },
